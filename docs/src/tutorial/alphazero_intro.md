# Introduction to AlphaZero

AlphaZero combines the two classes of techniques that are described in
Rich Sutton's essay
["The Bitter Lesson"](http://incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)
as the two fundamental pillars of modern AI: _search_ and _learning_.

### External resources

1. A good resource to learn about Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is this
   [Int8 tutorial](https://int8.io/monte-carlo-tree-search-beginners-guide/).
2. A simple and effective introduction to AlphaZero is Surag Nair's
   [excellent tutorial](https://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html).
3. Then, DeepMind's
   [original Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270)
   is a short and good read.
4. Finally, this [series of post](https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-implementing-alphazero-7e36e9054191)
   from Oracle was an important source of inspiration for us. It provides
   useful details on implementing asynchronous MCTS, along with an interesting
   discussion on hyperparameters tuning.
